        I. CHECK REGISTER FUNCTIONALITY

TC 10: 
Address and city fields don't throw error when they are completed with space character.
Phone number is valid even if is formed by 2 numbers.

TC 8 & 9:
From tests 8 and 9 it is seen that the importance of the boxes differs and that is why the alerts also differ and not 
everything we expect always appears. That's why we can't just rely on testing the content of alerts and that's why I 
test alerts if the url is as expected.

        II. CHECK LOGIN FUNCTIONALITY

All 6 tests passed but I suggest that the error's content being more specific. E.g. when both fields are blank, there is 
displayed the same error like both fields are completed: "Error: Incorrect login or password provided."
